This guide is used to setup a full development environment for the MIP Front dev.

Each service could be launch at any time without respecting any specific order, however as the frontend (react app) open automatically a browser tab for the local dev, it is recommended to follow this launch order

`Engine -> Gateway -> Frontend`
