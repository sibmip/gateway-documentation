### Introduction

The MIP Gateway is a middleware layer between the [MIP Frontend](https://github.com/HBPMedical/portal-frontend) and a federate analytic engine (Exareme, Datashield, FATE, MedCo, etc...). The general purpose of this documentation is to provide an overview of the architecture and to demonstrate how to create a connector for an engine.
